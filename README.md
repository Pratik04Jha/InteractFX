This is a lightweight, interactive web experience built for fun and creative experimentation with cursor effects and 3D ASCII text animations. It’s a small project to explore expressive front-end interactions using modern web technologies like Three.js.

Features
Splash Cursor Animation
A visually engaging splash effect follows the user's cursor, creating a playful interaction on every movement. This feature adds life to the navigation experience and makes the site feel reactive and dynamic.

3D ASCII Hover Text
ASCII-style text that comes to life in 3D when hovered over. Thanks to the power of Three.js, the text tilts, rotates, and responds smoothly to mouse movement, giving a sense of depth and interactivity.

Smooth Performance
Optimized for lightweight browsers and basic hardware. Despite being visually rich, the animations are handled efficiently to ensure performance across devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript – Base structure and styling

Three.js – Used for rendering the 3D interactive ASCII text

Custom Canvas Logic – Handles the splash cursor and other animation logic

Why This Project?
This project was created purely for fun and experimentation. It’s an exploration into making websites feel alive through small details that users can interact with. From cursor splashes to hover-sensitive text, every element is there to enhance the user's visual and tactile experience.

Setup Instructions
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
